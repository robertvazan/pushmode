PushMode is a server-side Java library that streams web app's HTML output down to the browser
while user's actions are streamed back to the server.
The only code the browser ever sees is a tiny JavaScript file.
Application effectively runs all on the server,
but interactivity is almost the same as if it was running in the browser.
This architecture has its [advantages](https://pushmode.machinezoo.com/architecture-comparison).
PushMode is reactive by default as it is based on [Hookless](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/).

## Status

Experimental. [Stagean](https://stagean.machinezoo.com/) is used to track progress on class and method level.
Read-only streaming of HTML to the client is fairly stable. Streaming of user input to the server is early alpha.
Browser APIs (e.g., history manipulation) aren't implemented at all.

## Getting started

See [homepage](https://pushmode.machinezoo.com/).
